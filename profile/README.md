# Porsche Open Source Platform

Welcome to the Porsche Open Source Platform on GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Following our [FOSS Movement](https://opensource.porsche.com/#foss-movement), we empower our employees to dedicate time for participating in FOSS activities.
You can find more information on how Porsche is contributing to open source and the standards we are endorsing for new projects to foster healthy communities
on our [public FOSS website](https://opensource.porsche.com/).

Furthermore, we appreciate any contribution to the [FOSS projects we're maintaining](https://github.com/orgs/porscheofficial/repositories?q=&type=source&language=&sort=).
You can find more information on the agreement under which you can contribute to our FOSS projects in our [Contributor License Agreement](https://opensource.porsche.com/docs/cla)
and in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file of the particular project.
